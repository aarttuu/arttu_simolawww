    <p>2 differences between HTML and HTML5</p>
    <p>1. HTML5 provides more smoother and more consistent experience.</p>
    <p>2. Better mobile support</p>

    <p>HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>
    <p>HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[6] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
